# mutagen-vst
VST to make you sound robotic, like some sort of advanced alien cyborg antagonist

## Installation
go to the latest release at https://github.com/micsthepick/mutagen-vst/releases, and download the appropriate version for your Windows or Wine installation.

## Usage (Windows)

check if your computer is 32 or 64 bit, and if the DAW/Host is 32 or 64 bits, and is capable of using a bridge, then copy the (x64) edition to `C:\Program Files\Steinberg\VSTPlugins`, and/or the (x32) edition to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steinberg\VSTPlugins`, and launch your typical VST hosting software, rescanning for plugins if necessary.

## Usage (Wine)
like for windows, locate Wine's root directory (shadow C drive) and copy to e.g. `~/.wine/C/Program Files/Steinberg/VSTPlugins`, and you will need to launch the DAW from wine too.
